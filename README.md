## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

### Overview
This project is a full stack SPRING MVC web application that allows the use to experiece
the C.R.U.D (create,read,update, and delete) functionality. This project is primarily focused
on the backend using Controller, DAO, Database.

### Concept
The application allows the use to search a list of movies by Film ID and also by keywords.
It accesses the movie database and is able to add,update and delete new and existing movies to the
database.

When a film is retrieved, it properties along with the cast members are displayed. I used
Request Mapping to map the JSP file with the Controller. The DAO (Database Accessor Object) is
the interface which is implemented by a implementing class. This is where most of the magic happens.
The controller class is mostly used to interconnect the actual java code with the the frontend display JSP.

I used some HTML and bootstrap for frontend. Mostly the project focuses on the backend functionality.

### Lessons Learned
This was a challenging project because of the fact that we are very new to mapping the objects and
passing values. It was difficult at the beginning, however the more I dove into the project, the more
I felt comfortable and understood the concepts. Being able to explore among the different classes and files
was the most challenging but the most rewarding moment.
